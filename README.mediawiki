=Enhanced Script Environment Add-On for Alfresco=

==Module Features==

The Enhanced Script Environment Add-On shall provide additional functionality for the server-side JavaScript environments of both the Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share tier. These features aim to make it easier for script programmers to reuse existing code fragments, provide new extensibility hooks without the need for significant platform changes and implement valid, syntactically correct scripts that can be used in JavaScript-enabled IDEs and debuggers.

The following is an incomplete list of currently planned features:

* Replacement of pre-processor import handling with native JavaScript API function resulting in syntactically valid files that can be handled by JavaScript-enabled IDEs and debuggers 
* Extensible framework for alternative methods of discovery of scripts to import
** Import via classpath
** Import via "extensible" classpath (i.e. supporting overrides in extension / web-extension)
** Import via XPath
** Import via NodeRef
** Import via simple name path
** Import via abstract names and script registries
* Ability to execute imported scripts in an isolated or pre-defined context
* Ability to parameterize method of discovery of scripts to import
* Context-/Script-aware logging facility to allow selective configuration of script logging levels (instead of using the global ScriptLogger for all logging)
* Providing access to mapped diagnostic context from script logging
* Providing batch processing capabilities within scripts

This list is open for suggestions from the Alfresco community

==Usage==

===Import API===

The enhanced script environment module adds a clean, native script import API to the JavaScript runtime of both the Repository and Share / Surf tier, obsoleting the previous preprocessor-style &lt;import&gt;-tags. The new API also allows for developers to provide extensions that locate scripts to import based on arbitrary conditions, including resolution parameters provided by the importing script itself.
All existing &lt;import&gt;-tags are automatically converted to the corresponding API invocations before execution of a script. The module obsoletes and abolishes all kinds of script merging before execution.

The import API consists of the following functions / function variants:

 importScript(string locatorType, string location)
 importScript(string locatorType, string location, boolean failIfMissing)
 importScript(string locatorType, string location, boolean failIfMissing, object resolutionParameters, object scope)

The parameters server the following purpose:

* string locatorType (mandatory) - The identifier of the type of locator to use in resolving the script location
* string location (mandatory) - The location value of the script to import, resolvable by the locator
* boolean failIfMissing (optional) - Should the function fail if the script to import cannot be located
* object resolutionParameters (optional) - The parameters passed to the locator (if not null) for resolution of the script. Any object will be converted to a (complex) key-value map before passing it to the Java implementation of the ScriptLocator-interface
* object scope (optional) - The scope in which the imported script shall be executed. Defaults to the current scope if null or not provided. Specifying a scope for the import allows the importing script to isolate itself from the imported script, since the imported script can only access (and potentially modify) elements of the provided scope.


The following script locator types (implementations of the Java interface ScriptLocator) are provided by the module out-of-the-box:

* General
** classpath - Loads a script from the classpath either using absolute notation with a leading "/" or relative notation. If the importing script can not be identified as originating from the classpath itself, location values without a leading "/" will also be treated as absolute locations.
** registry - Loads a registered script from a registry by an arbitrary name, independently of where it is actually located. The name can also be suffixed with a "@&lt;subRegistry&gt;" identifier where &lt;subRegistry&gt; addresses a specific subset of registered scripts, i.e. "documentlibrary-v2-filters" for document library filters if scripts have been registered that way. 
* Repository-only
** legacyNamePath - Loads a script using simplified FileFolderService name-paths, either in absolute notation with leading "/" or relatively if the importing script can be identified as originating from the Alfresco Content Repository.
** node - Loads a script from a specific content object identified by the NodeRef-containing location value.
** xpath - Loads a script from the Alfresco Content Repository using a XPath expression with either the store root node or current script node (if importing script has itself been loaded from the Repository) as the context. NOTE: The differentiation between relative and absolute XPath paths is left to the Alfresco XPath search language - only the context node will be dynamically determined by the locator.
* Surf / Share-only
** storePath - Loads a script from the underlying search path across registered document stores, delegating the actual lookup to the Share / Surf environment. Depending on the search path configuration the imported script may be loaded from a remote source location, i.e. an Alfresco Repository. Any location with a leading "/" will be treated as an absolute location. In case the importing script can not be identified as originating from the Surf store APIs, relative location values (without leading "/") will also be treated as absolute locations. NOTE: The Share / Surf environment have distinct search paths for template and web script controller scripts. Depending on the controller script that performs the import, only the corresponding search path will be considered.

===Import API Examples===

The following API invocations are full equivalents (and replacements) of the corresponding &lt;import&gt;-tag import directives:

 <import resource="classpath:alfresco/templates/webscripts/org/alfresco/repository/blogs/blogpost.lib.js">
 // absolute call:
 importScript("classpath", "/alfresco/templates/webscripts/org/alfresco/respository/blogs/blogpost.lib.js");
 // relative call from blog-post.put.json.js webscript controller (if loaded from the classpath)
 importScript("classpath", "../blogpost.lib.js");
 
 <import resource="/Company Home/Data Dictionary/Scripts/includeme.js"> // (only in Repository tier)
 // absolute call:
 importScript("legacyNamePath", "/Company Home/Data Dictionary/Scripts/includeme.js");
 // relative call from another script in one-level sub-directory of the Data Dictionary (planned, not yet implemented):
 importScript("legacyNamePath", "../includeme.js");
 
 <import resource="workspace://SpacesStore/6f73de1b-d3b4-11db-80cb-112e6c2ea048">
 // call (planned, not yet implemented):
 importScript("node", "workspace://SpacesStore/6f73de1b-d3b4-11db-80cb-112e6c2ea048");
 
 <import resource="/org/springframework/extensions/surf/api.lib.js"> // (only in Share / Surf tier)
 // absolute call:
 importScript("storePath", "/org/springframework/extensions/surf/api.lib.js");
 // relative call from Surf client.get.js web script controller to api.lib.js:
 importScript("storePath", ../api.lib.js");
 

The following is an example of an "isolated scope import" to guard against unwanted access and manipulation of data:

 // logic of importing script "importer.get.js"
 function getSomeValueFromRepo(){
    // business logic
 }
 
 function main(){
    model.someValue = getSomeValueFromRepo();
    
    var importScope = {
       model: {},
       args: args
    };
    
    // this call allows script.js to access the importScope (and regular root object), but nothing from importer.get.js (i.e. its own model or getSomeValueFromRepo) unless it is provided as a member of importScope (like args)
    importScript("classpath", "/path/to/script.js", true, null, importScope);
    // importer.get.js expects script.js to set someOtherValue in the provided scope model 
    model.someOtherValue = importScope.model.someOtherValue;
 }
 
 main();
