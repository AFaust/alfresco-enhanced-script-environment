=Enhanced Script Environment Add-On for Alfresco=

==Module Features==

The Enhanced Script Environment Add-On shall provide additional functionality for the server-side JavaScript environments of both the Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share tier. These features aim to make it easier for script programmers to reuse existing code fragments, provide new extensibility hooks without the need for significant platform changes and implement valid, syntactically correct scripts that can be used in JavaScript-enabled IDEs and debuggers.

The following is an incomplete list of currently planned features:

* Replacement of pre-processor import handling with native JavaScript API function resulting in syntactically valid files that can be handled by JavaScript-enabled IDEs and debuggers 
* Extensible framework for alternative methods of discovery of scripts to import
** Import via classpath
** Import via "extensible" classpath (i.e. supporting overrides in extension / web-extension)
** Import via XPath
** Import via NodeRef
** Import via simple name path
** Import via abstract names and script registries
* Ability to execute imported scripts in an isolated or pre-defined context
* Ability to parameterize method of discovery of scripts to import
* Context-/Script-aware logging facility to allow selective configuration of script logging levels (instead of using the global ScriptLogger for all logging)
* Providing access to mapped diagnostic context from script logging
* Providing batch processing capabilities within scripts
* Providing remote JavaScript debugging using Eclipse JSDT tooling

This list is open for suggestions from the Alfresco community
